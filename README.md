# 📊 Azure Cost Monitoring Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Microsoft Azure cloud cost data using **Power BI**.
The dashboard helps monitor cloud spending, identify cost trends, and support basic **cost optimization and governance decisions** commonly used in enterprise environments.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Cloud platforms follow a pay-as-you-go model, which can lead to uncontrolled spending if costs are not monitored regularly.
This project demonstrates how Azure billing data can be transformed into meaningful insights to improve visibility and cost management.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Azure** – Cost Management & Billing
* **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling and visualization
* **Azure Billing CSV Data** – Cost dataset
